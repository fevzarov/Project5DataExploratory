Project name: Chemical Properties Influencing Red Wine’s Quality

The goal of this project is to determine chemical properties that influence the quality of red wines. Since this is a project for data uni-, bi-, and multivariate data visualization in R, the crux of the analyses focuses on such data visualization and miltivariate analyses. The visualizations provide depictions on variable distributions and relations between variables, which lend to model building in the regression analyses.
